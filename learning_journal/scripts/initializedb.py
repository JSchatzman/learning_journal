Once I got to working on the pyramid assignment I was pretty lost and I'm still trying to work through it. I have no doubt that pyramid is awesome, and while I can follow along with the class notes, I'm not really at a point yet where I understand what's going on. I'm hoping that will change soon.",

One day after the introduction, the first assignment sounds like a breeze. It seems things start to soak in the next day instead of during lecture. The human brain acts in funny ways. I've also come to accept the fact that this class will take over my life until it is over. it's a significant sacrifice that people more knowledgeable than myself think I must take to get to where I know I want to go.",
